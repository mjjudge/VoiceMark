# Functional Documentation

This directory contains functional specifications and requirements for VoiceMark features.

## Contents

### Planned Documentation

- **Feature Requirements** - Detailed requirements for each feature
- **User Stories** - Use cases and user scenarios
- **Voice Commands** - Complete reference for voice commands
- **Workflow Documentation** - User workflows and processes
- **Integration Specifications** - How VoiceMark integrates with other tools

## Documentation Structure

Each functional specification should include:

1. **Feature Overview**: What the feature does
2. **User Stories**: Who needs it and why
3. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the feature works
5. **Dependencies**: What other features or components it relies on
6. **Future Enhancements**: Potential improvements

## User-Centric Approach

Functional documentation should be written from the user's perspective:

- Focus on "what" not "how"
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Include examples and use cases
- Consider different user types (accessibility, power users, etc.)
