# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for VoiceMark, including system design, component diagrams, and architectural patterns.

## Contents

### Planned Documentation

- **System Overview** - High-level architecture of VoiceMark
- **Component Architecture** - Detailed component design and interactions
- **Data Flow** - How data moves through the system
- **Speech Recognition Architecture** - Integration with speech recognition engines
- **Storage Architecture** - File system organization and note management
- **Security Architecture** - Privacy and security considerations

## Documentation Guidelines

When adding architecture documentation:

1. **Start with Context**: Explain what problem the architecture solves
2. **Use Diagrams**: Visual representations are invaluable
3. **Show Trade-offs**: Document alternatives and why they were not chosen
4. **Link to ADRs**: Reference related Architecture Decision Records
5. **Keep Updated**: Update documentation when architecture changes

## Diagram Location

Store architectural diagrams in the `../diagrams/` directory and reference them from here.
